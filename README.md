# Paisabazaar Banking Fraud Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Paisabazaar's banking data to understand customer credit behavior and detect potential fraudulent activities. The goal is to extract insights to improve credit risk assessment, personalize recommendations, and enhance fraud detection mechanisms.

## Business Problem

Paisabazaar faces the challenge of accurately assessing the creditworthiness of its customers and identifying fraudulent activities. Misclassification of credit scores can lead to increased loan defaults, suboptimal financial product recommendations, and revenue losses.

## Objectives

* Minimize loan default risks.
* Detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
* Improve personalized financial recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 100,000 records with 28 features, representing various financial and behavioral attributes of customers. It includes information like income, loans, delayed payments, and credit utilization.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and validating the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables for analysis (e.g., SSN Validity, Salary Discrepancy).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using visualizations and statistical methods to uncover insights.
4. **Insights Extraction:** Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
5. **Actionable Recommendations:** Proposing strategies for fraud detection, risk mitigation, and product personalization.

## Key Insights

* **Fraud Indicators:** Invalid SSNs and high-risk behaviors (excessive loans, credit card usage) are potential fraud indicators.
* **Credit Score Patterns:** Poor credit scores correlate with delayed payments, high debt, and bad credit mixes.
* **Demographics:** Young adults (25-33) and middle-aged adults (34-42) show stronger credit profiles.
* **Financial Behaviors:** Delayed payments and outstanding debt strongly correlate with poor credit scores.

## Visualization Highlights

The project utilizes various visualizations, including:

* Pie charts and histograms for credit score distribution.
* Heatmaps to highlight correlations between risk factors.
* Dual-axis charts to uncover trends in loan behaviors.

## Actionable Recommendations

The analysis led to several recommendations for Paisabazaar:

* Strengthen SSN validation processes and flag high-risk behaviors.
* Incorporate delayed payments and salary discrepancies into risk models.
* Offer personalized financial products based on customer profiles.
* Adjust interest rates based on risk profiles to reduce defaults.
* Educate customers on financial planning and credit management.

## Conclusion

This EDA project provides valuable insights into credit risk assessment and fraud detection. By implementing the recommendations, Paisabazaar can optimize lending policies, enhance customer satisfaction, and build long-term trust.
